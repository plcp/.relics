# cars
Millions of cars driving toward the mouse pointer.

# Quick setup
Use the `Makefile`to build:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/plcp/cars.git
cd cars
make
```

Note that you may have more or less a million, as the simulation will scale
down to keep the framerate high.

# Requirements

Building [clenche](https://github.com/plcp/clenche) and the `SFML`.

Tested with `g++ (GCC) 7.1.1 20170630` and `SFMLÂ 2.4.2`.
